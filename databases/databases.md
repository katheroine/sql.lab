# Databases

In computing, a **database** is an organized collection of **data** or a type of **data store** based on the use of a **database management system (DBMS)**, the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a **database system**. Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.

Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.

Computer scientists may classify database management systems according to the **database models** that they support. **Relational databases** became dominant in the 1980s. *These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data.* In the 2000s, **non-relational databases** became popular, collectively referred to as **NoSQL**, because they use different query languages.

## SQL databases

**When to use MySQL, when PostrgeSQL, when MariaDB and when SQLite?**

* **SQLite** is a *lightweight, embedded* database that's often used for *smaller applications* or when you need a database that *doesn't require a separate server*. It's a good choice for *mobile apps, desktop applications*, and other scenarios where you need a *simple and efficient database*.

* **MySQL** is a widely used, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its *speed and reliability*. It's a good choice for applications that require *robust transaction support and complex querying capabilities* with relational data.

* **MariaDB** is a fork of MySQL, designed to be a *fully compatible and enhanced* version. It's a good choice for applications that require *high availability, security, interoperability, and performance capabilities*.

* **PostgreSQL** is another popular open-source RDBMS that excels in *complex data models and high-traffic scenarios*. It's often preferred for applications that demand *high data integrity and advanced features like foreign key constraints and triggers*.

Ultimately, the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. Consider factors like the size and complexity of your data, the performance requirements of your application, and the level of support you need.

Choosing the right database for your application can significantly impact performance, scalability, and development efficiency. Let's break down when to use each of these popular options:  

**SQLite**

Best for: Embedded systems, small desktop applications, mobile apps, and prototyping.  

Why:

* Lightweight and self-contained: No separate server process required.
* ACID compliance: Ensures data integrity.
* Fast: Very efficient for small datasets.

Limitations:

* Not suitable for high concurrency or large datasets.  
* No built-in replication or clustering.

**MySQL**

Best for: Web applications, e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and high-traffic websites.  

Why:

* Fast and efficient for read-heavy workloads.  
* Easy to use and manage.  
* Strong community support and extensive ecosystem.
* Good performance for medium-sized datasets.  

Limitations:

* Less advanced features compared to PostgreSQL.  
* Can struggle with complex queries and large datasets.  

**MariaDB**

Best for: High-performance applications, cloud-based deployments, and migrating from MySQL.

Why:

* Fork of MySQL with performance improvements and additional features.
* Compatible with MySQL, making migration easier.  
* Strong focus on scalability and performance.  
* Offers columnar storage for analytical workloads.  

Limitations:

* Smaller community compared to MySQL.
* Some features might be less mature than PostgreSQL.

**PostgreSQL**

Best for: Complex applications, data warehousing, geospatial data, and real-time analytics.  

Why:

* Advanced features like JSONB, full-text search, and advanced querying.  
* Strong ACID compliance and data integrity.  
* Scalable and supports large datasets.  
* Active development and strong community.  

Limitations:

* Can be more resource-intensive than MySQL or MariaDB.
* Steeper learning curve for complex features.

**Key Considerations**

* **Data volume and complexity**: Small datasets are ideal for SQLite, while large and complex datasets favor PostgreSQL.  

* **Performance**: MySQL and MariaDB excel in read-heavy workloads, while PostgreSQL offers better performance for complex queries.  

* **Features**: PostgreSQL provides a rich feature set, including advanced data types and functions.  

* **Scalability**: MariaDB and PostgreSQL are better suited for scaling than MySQL and SQLite.

* **Cost**: SQLite is free and self-contained, while others require server infrastructure.  

* **Community and support**: MySQL and PostgreSQL have larger communities and more resources available.

Remember: There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The best database depends on your specific application requirements. It's often helpful to prototype with different options to make an informed decision.
